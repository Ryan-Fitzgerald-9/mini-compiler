# Mini-Compiler

This is a small compiler that outputs C code after implementing a dialect of BASIC. It will support basic operations such as:

- Numerical variables
- Basic arithmetic
- If statements
- While loops
- Print
- Labels and goto
- Comments

## Overview
![Compiler Overview](/compiler-img.png)

The compiler follows a three step process consisting of the lexer, parser, and emitter.

- ***Lexer***: responsible for scanning the source code, breaking it down into tokens (keyword, identifier, operator, etc.), and categorizing each token into different types
- ***Parser***: analyzes the stream of tokens from the Lexer and creates a parse tree based on constructs of the language
- ***Emitter***: takes the parsed tokens generated by the Parser and translates them into the output format (C code)
